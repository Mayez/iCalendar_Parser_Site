Hello Everyone,
  this entire CalendarApp file is meant to contain all code for the C parser library and its make file along with a the HTML
  and client side JS which is the index.js and index.html . The app.js contains the server side Javascript code along with
  the MySQL queries. This code is only meant for showing purposes as node modules need to be installed on your computer
  via npm-install and same for the mysql plugin install using npm -install mysql -save in the package.json file.
  Also, the database that I was sshing into is no longer available.
  
  This is a application that takes .ics files aka iCalendar Files and parses the file using a C library.
  then it communicates with the server side Node.js and then as a result the client side HTML and JS.
  
Thank you
