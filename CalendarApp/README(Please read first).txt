Thank you for reading this .txt document
There are things that I was not able to finish:
	1.Any of the additional queries

Also, all A4 related stuff is below the header A4
Assumptions I Made:
	1.The count for number of files, alarms and events in the database is
	in the status panel at the very top as I was not sure where to put it
	2.The connection status to the database is right below the login button
	as well as the status panel
	3. I added the alarm table at the end of the page but, there is no 
	functionality. It is there for UI purposes.
